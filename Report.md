# Robotics_dev_RoadMap
Road map to be a Robotics developer
inspired by [awsome robotics](https://github.com/kiloreux/awesome-robotics) <br/>
but the idea is to make a step by step guide
## Report
The idea was simple making making a road map

At first mohamed played the role of the maintainer and created the repo, Then we decide that every one of us work on couple of branches and we make branches here like  feature based project every one will work on a different feature or in our case a readme file
The work goes as follows:
* Mohamed created the repo
* Make a couple of branches
* Mostafa make a couple of branches
* Mostafa try to edit the readme at first
* Face a problem of how to update the forked version

The solution
https://rick.cogley.info/post/update-your-forked-repository-directly-on-github/

The Work complete as follows we start to edit the branches and make pull requests then merging to tha main at last 

Other problem was a misconception from us, we thought that the person who fork the repo(Mostafa) will be able to make commits on the branches created by the author (mohamed) which was not true so the solution was even (Mostafa) create his own branches or the author (Mohamed) add him as a contributor
