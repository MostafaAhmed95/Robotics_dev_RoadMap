# Robotics_dev_RoadMap
Road map to be a Robotics developer
inspired by [awsome robotics](https://github.com/kiloreux/awesome-robotics) <br/>
but the idea is to make a step by step guide

## How to start
* [Beginner ROS TUTS](https://github.com/mohamedsayed18/Robotics_dev_RoadMap/blob/master/Beginners.md.txt)

* [Robotics software developer](https://github.com/mohamedsayed18/Robotics_dev_RoadMap/blob/master/Dev.md)

* [Jobs](https://github.com/mohamedsayed18/Robotics_dev_RoadMap/blob/master/Jobs.md)

* [Self_help](https://github.com/mohamedsayed18/Robotics_dev_RoadMap/blob/master/self.md)


 note this project was done as part of FRP (Fundamental robotics programming) at Innopolis university
